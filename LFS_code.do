* Processing education level data for analysis
*This code segment is designed to process the 'YearsOfEdu' variable, which quantifies the number of years of education an individual has completed. Initially, it ensures that 'YearsOfEdu' is in a numeric format, enabling numerical operations and comparisons. Subsequently, it introduces a binary variable 'HigherEdu' to distinguish individuals with a higher level of education. Specifically, it identifies those who have completed between 5 to 9 years of education as having higher education, which likely corresponds to completing secondary education and possibly some post-secondary education. This binary categorization facilitates further analysis focused on assessing the impact or correlation of higher educational attainment within the dataset's context.

* Adjusting the 'Age' variable for employment analysis
*This code snippet processes the 'Age' variable to ensure it is in a numeric format suitable for analysis, then filters out individuals under the age of 15. This action is taken because, in the context of employment studies within Iran, individuals are considered part of the labor force starting from the age of 15. This aligns with many international standards, including those of the International Labour Organization (ILO), which often categorize the working-age population as those aged 15 and above. By removing younger individuals, the dataset is refined to focus only on the portion of the population relevant to employment analysis, ensuring the accuracy and relevancy of subsequent findings.
